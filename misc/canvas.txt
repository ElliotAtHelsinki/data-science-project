Motivation

The aim of our project is to study the usage of the citybikes in Helsinki. It is a difficult operations research problem to level the number of citybikes at each station so that there is no excess demand of bikes. To study this problem we aim to use time-series methods to study the demand of citybikes at each station, conditioning on, for example, the weather.  

Data collection

HSL has an dataset that contains all driven trips that is offered for free on their website. We aim to also use historical weather data from Helsinki.

The dataset is not huge in size and we do not need to support real-time updates to the database and hence, we plan to store the dataset in csv-files in the repository.

We probably have to collect data also about the number of bikestops at each station, however, it is probably not possible to gather a complete dataset so we will probably have to impute these numbers.

Preprocessing

We obtained the bike data directly from HSL. In addition, we have hourly weather data from Open-Meteo from 1th of April in 2016 to 12th of September in 2024. 

First steps are to combine these datasets. Our dataset is of high quality (nothing is estimated using proxy variables or scraped in a way that could compromise the quality), however, there are some preprocessing tasks. For example, we need to encode all categorical variables (for example, bike stations). In case our data is missing observations, we need to decide on imputation. 

Exploratory data analysis

First, we will study the descriptive statistics; mean and variance of trips by time of day. We will also employ descrictive work to guide us in choosing of an appropriate model. For example, we might need to transform our data (e.g. take logarithms) and we can use visualizations for this task.
